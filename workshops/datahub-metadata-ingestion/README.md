# Ingesting Metadata into Data Catalogue (DataHub)

Data & Analytics held a session at the T&I conference in November 2021.
In the workshop, some example metadata is ingested into DataHub. It can now be found in
[the documentation of the data platform](https://compassdocs.hellman.oxygen.dfds.cloud/en/workshops/datahub) (The Compass).
