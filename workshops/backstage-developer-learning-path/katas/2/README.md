Novo Nordisk Backstage Training - Code Kata #2
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) at Novo Nordisk and serves as a starting point for developers looking to onboard [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/).

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one or more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and update the kata via a [pull request](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
* [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (windows only)

## Exercise
The objective of this exercise is to guide developers through the process of setting up and configuring [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) TechDocs plugin to document a sample project. It will built on the previous exercise to extend our [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) configuration with the aim of exploring the different configuration options available, such as specifying documentation repositories, markdown rendering settings, and more.

Once completed the participants will have gained a basic understanding of the folllowing aspects of the `TechDocs`:

* TechDocs configuration
* TechDocs assets
* TechDocs publication and versioning

### 1. Create a kata directory
First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```
mkdir kata2
cd kata2
```
