Novo Nordisk Backstage Training - Code Kata #3
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) at Novo Nordisk and serves as a starting point for developers looking to onboard [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/).

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one or more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and update the kata via a [pull request](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
* [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (windows only)

## Exercise
In this exercise you are tasked with setting up a new `software template` in [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) for a specific type of service or application used within our organization. The goal is to create a template that can be reused to generate similar services or applications easily.

Upon completion the participants will have gained a basic understanding of the folllowing aspects of the `software template`:

* Identifing requirements
* Creating templates
* Parameterization & customization


### 1. Create a kata directory
First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```
mkdir kata3
cd kata3
```
