Novo Nordisk Backstage Training - Code Kata #4
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) at Novo Nordisk and serves as a starting point for developers looking to onboard [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/).

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one or more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and update the kata via a [pull request](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
* [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (windows only)

## Exercise
This exercise is designed to help developers gain familiarity with the `software catalog` in [Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/) and will build on the previous exercises to help deepen their understanding of how to manage and utilize this key feature. As this exercise will only cover the basics, participants are encouraged to extend on the subject by reading the upstream documentation [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/).

Once completed the participants will have gained a basic understanding of the folllowing aspects of the `software catalog`:

* Configuring the software catalog.
* Registering APIs and components within the software catalog.
* Implement metadata, such as labels, descriptions, and versions, for software entities.
* Extending the software catalog with custom software entities.

### 1. Create a kata directory
First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```
mkdir kata4
cd kata4
```
