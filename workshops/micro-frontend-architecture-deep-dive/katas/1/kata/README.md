DFDS MFA Training - Code Kata #1
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on micro frontend architecture that serves as a starting point for Developers looking to onboard the MFA efforts at DFDS.


## Getting started

These instructions will help you prepare for the code kata and make sure that your local developer machine has the correct tools installed and configured.


### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Exercise

Your first assignment will see you build a simple HTML Template that will allows us to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in a document by scripts.


### 1. Create your project directory
`mkdir /kata1`<br/>
`cd /kata1`


### 2. Create a simple HTML document
It's pretty simple: create a file named `fun-with-templates.html` containing the following code:

***Note*** <br/>
You can use `vi` to edit the file: <br/>
`fun-with-templates.html` will create the file and open the editor.

```
<html>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
