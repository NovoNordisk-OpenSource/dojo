DFDS Azure Monitoring Training - Code kata #3
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on Azure Monitoring that serves as a starting point for Developers looking to get started with distributed tracing at DFDS. 

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one of more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and update the kata via a [pull request](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
* [Kata #2](../2/kata/README.md)

## Exercise
This exercise will focus on working with Metrics in the Application Insights SDK and how to make it easy using the custom Logging and Metrics NuGet packages provided by the (C)IAM team on our internal feed to help streamline logs and metrics across all Azure Monitoring workspaces in our organization. 

### 1. Create a kata directory
First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```
mkdir kata3
cd kata3
```
