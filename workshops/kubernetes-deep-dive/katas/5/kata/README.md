DFDS Kubernetes Training - Code kata #5
======================================

## Getting started

These instructions will help you prepare for the code kata and make sure that your local developer machine has the right tools installed and configured.

### Prerequisites

* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Powershell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6)

## Exercise

By default, Kubernetes pods have unrestricted network access both inside and outside the cluster. However it is often desirable to restrict network access to and from pods, particularly for security reasons, which has lead your team to identify a need to restrict access to the mysql pod and their precious data. Thankfully Kubernetes NetworkPolicies provide a flexible way to implement these networking restrictions, giving you control over all of the network traffic involving your pods. 


### 1. Create a kata directory for our exercise files
`mkdir /kata5`<br/>
`cd /kata5`

### 2. Create a NetworkPolicy descriptor file to allocate some storage in our cluster
Create a file named "mysql-network-policy.yml" and add a NetworkPolicy definition:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: mysql-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
```

Just to explain: <br/>
`.kind: NetworkPolicy` - Specifies a need to create an object of kind (type) NetworkPolicy. <br/>
`.spec.podSelector: ...` -  A podSelector selects the grouping of pods to which a policy applies within a given namespace. The example policy selects pods with the label "app=db‚Äù. An empty podSelector selects all pods in the namespace.<br/>
`.spec.policyTypes: ...` -  The policyTypes field indicates whether or not the given policy applies to ingress traffic to selected pod, egress traffic from selected pods, or both.<br/>

### 3. Use kubectl to apply our new network policy
`kubectl apply -f mysql-network-policy.yml`

### 4. Use kubectl to examine the newly created network policy
`kubectl describe networkpolicy mysql-network-policy`
