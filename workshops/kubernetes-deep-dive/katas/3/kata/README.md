DFDS Kubernetes Training - Code kata #3
======================================

This training exercise is a **beginner-level** course on Kubernetes that serves as a starting point for developers looking get started with container orchestration at DFDS.

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata exercise and ensure that your local machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one of more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and create a [pull request](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Powershell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6)

## Exercise
Your team has just deployed two components of their web application to a managed k8s cluster using deployment objects with multiple replicas. But now they want you to provide dynamic network access for their pod replicas so that there will be uninterrupted access to the components whenever replicas are created, removed, or replaced by their CI/CD pipelines. Furthermore the mvc-frontend deployment, your teams .NET core MVC application, needs to be accessible to users outside the cluster and the api-backend deployment should only be accessible by other pods in the cluster.

### 1. Create your kata directory
First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```
mkdir kata3
cd kata3
```

### 2. Create a service descriptor file for our mvc-frontend deployment
Create a file named "mvc-svc.yml" and add a service definition:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mvc-svc
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: mvc
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 5000
```

Just to explain: <br/>
`.kind: Service` - Specifies a need to create an object of kind (type) Service. <br/>
`.metadata.name: my-pod` - Instructs k8s to name our pod "my-pod" so we can reference it via kubectl, from other manifests, etc. <br/>
`.metadata.labels: ` - Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects.<br/>
`.spec.type: NodePort` - Instructs k8s to expose our service using an IP that is external to the cluster. <br/>

### 3. Use kubectl to create our new service
`kubectl apply -f mvc-svc.yml`

Just to explain: <br/>
`kubectl apply` - Apply a resource from a file or from stdin. <br/>
`-f .\mvc-svc.yml` -f point to the filename, directory or URL containing our "resource manifest" files.

### 4. Create a service descriptor file for our api-backend deployment
Create a file named "api-svc.yml" and add a service definition:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-svc
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: Â¨5000
```

Just to explain: <br/>
`.spec.type: ClusterIP` - Instructs k8s to expose our service using an IP that is internal to the cluster. <br/>

### 5. Use kubectl to create our new service
`kubectl apply -f api-svc.yml`

### 6. Verify that services are created
`kubectl get svc`

Just to explain: <br/>
`kubectl get svc` - Fetches all services in the current namespace. <br/>

### 7. Verify that mvc-svc has been created
`kubectl get ep mvc-svc`

### 8. Verify that api-svc has been created
`kubectl get ep api-svc`

### 9. Verify that api-svc and mvc-svc has pods to route traffic too
`kubectl get pods -l app=api`
`kubectl get pods -l app=mvc`
